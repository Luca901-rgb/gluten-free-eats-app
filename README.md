## Development Instructions

Due to issues with Rollup native modules, please use the following scripts to run the application:

### Windows:
```
run-dev.bat
```

### Linux/MacOS:
```
chmod +x run-dev.sh
./run-dev.sh
```

These scripts include necessary patches to prevent errors with Rollup native modules.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter module loading errors, try cleaning and reinstalling dependencies:

### Windows:
```
clean-reinstall.bat
```

### Linux/MacOS:
```
chmod +x clean-reinstall.sh
./clean-reinstall.sh
```
